For the American Buttercream:
In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the room temperature butter until smooth.
Sift in the confectioner’s sugar. You can add the sugar in two batches.
Beat until you get to a desired consistency. Add a few drops of rose water. Make sure the buttercream is thick.
Dye a few batches yellow, soft pink and pink. Use some matcha powder to create a natural leaf color. Transfer the green buttercream to a bag fitted with a 68 tip.
Transfer buttercream to piping bag fitted with a 120 and 127 tip to make the petals.
Cut a square of parchment paper. Use a tiny bit of buttercream to glue down the paper onto a piping nail.
For the roses, place a small cone of very thick buttercream in the middle of the square.
Add bits of yellow in the middle for added dimension. Pipe the petals using a 120 and 127 tip.
